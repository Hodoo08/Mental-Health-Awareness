            <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act.
              Mental illness is a general term for a group of illnesses that may include symptoms that can affect a person’s thinking, perceptions, mood or behaviour. 
              Mental illness can make it difficult for someone to cope with work, relationships and other demands.
              The relationship between stress and mental illness is complex, but it is known that stress can worsen an episode of mental illness. 
              Most people can manage their mental illness with medication, counselling or both. 
              This page lists some of the more common mental health issues and mental illnesses.
