# Mental-Health-Awareness

## Overview
This project is a single-page, responsive website designed to provide accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health in a supportive and organised layout. Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the website offers a calming user experience that aims to empower visitors with knowledge and practical tips. The siteâ€™s design is optimised for easy navigation, and features a clear, structured format to support users in exploring mental health topics with confidence.

## UX Design Process
- **Link to User Stories in GitHub Projects:**
  - [GitHub Projects Kanban Board](https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-awareness/projects)
- **Wireframes:**
  - [Wireframes](https://github.com/Hodoo08/Mental-Health-Awareness/blob/main/assets/New%20Project%201%20wireframe%20Final.pdf)
  - The wireframes were designed with high colour contrast and alt text for visual elements to ensure accessibility. The layout and design choices were made to enhance usability and accessibility for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
- **Design Rationale:**
  - Key design decisions include a clean and simple layout, a calming colour scheme with green and white tones, and the use of Arial, a widely accessible font. Accessibility guidelines such as WCAG were integrated by ensuring sufficient colour contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility.

## Key Features
- **Feature 1:** Informative sections on mental health topics, including definitions, types of disorders, and support tips.
- **Feature 2:** Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Inclusivity Notes:** 
  - The features address the needs of diverse users, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), by providing clear, structured information and ensuring accessibility.

## Deployment
- **Platform:** GitHub Pages
- **High-Level Deployment Steps:** 
  1. Push the code to the GitHub repository.
  2. Go to the repository settings.
  3. Enable GitHub Pages and select the main branch as the source.
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - The deployed version was verified to match the development version in functionality. Additional checks were performed to ensure the accessibility of the deployed application.
- **Security Measures:**
  - Environment variables were used for sensitive data.
  - DEBUG mode was disabled in production.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
(Highlight how prompts, such as reverse, question-and-answer or multi-step, were used to support learners with SEND or ALN where relevant.)

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - Reflection: Strategic use of AI allowed for rapid prototyping, with minor adjustments for alignment with project goals. 
    - Examples: Reverse prompts for alternative code solutions and question-answer prompts for resolving specific challenges.
  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.
  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.
  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included implementing basic grid layout of webpage and getting the correct identifiers for css classes.

## Testing Summary
- **Manual Testing:**
  - **Devices and Browsers Tested:** Desktop (Chrome, Firefox), Mobile (Safari, Chrome), including testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.
  - **Features Tested:** Navigation, content accessibility, responsiveness, and form submissions.
  - **Results:** Some fearures are not active or responsive yet. Still trying to debug and find problem to the root issue.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Tools Used: Bootstrap
  - Features Covered: Navigation, form validation, and content rendering.
  - Adjustments Made: Manual corrections to AI-generated test cases were made to ensure comprehensive coverage, particularly for accessibility.

## Future Enhancements
- Better layout, maybe go for a more complex layout and add multiple pages.
- Provide additional language support.
- Implement more interactive features such as quizzes and forums.
